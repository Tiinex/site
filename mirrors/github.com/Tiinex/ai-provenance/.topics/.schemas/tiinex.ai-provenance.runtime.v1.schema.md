# tiinex.ai-provenance.runtime.v1
- Status: provisional runtime schema note
- Schema Definition: [tiinex.schema.v1](https://github.com/Tiinex/docs/blob/f87360aea750afe382aabae1fd208556a8fc99bd/.topics/.schemas/tiinex.schema.v1.schema.md)
- Origin:
  - [relative](../../tiinex_ai_runtime_m0_provider_boundary_plan_v2.md)
  - [absolute](C:/Users/micro/Documents/Repos/Tiinex/ai-provenance/tiinex_ai_runtime_m0_provider_boundary_plan_v2.md)

## Summary

This schema names the concrete ai-provenance TRACEABLE runtime result shape
that M0 preserves while model-provider routing becomes provider-agnostic.

It is intentionally narrower than the generic
`tiinex.ai.runtime.v1` parent schema and only owns the concrete fields that the
local TRACEABLE runtime actually emits, persists, or meaningfully preserves.

## Schema Validation Contract

The following sections contain the validation-relevant contract for this
child schema. Validation tooling and runtime checks should consult the rules
below when deciding whether an artifact is a valid `tiinex.ai-provenance.runtime.v1`
emission.

### Scope Rule

Use `tiinex.ai-provenance.runtime.v1` when the artifact or embedded state is
primarily trying to preserve a concrete TRACEABLE child-lane result or evidence
state for this repository's runtime.

This schema is for the parseable ai-provenance runtime result shape, not for the
broader abstract AI-runtime model and not for generic topic documents.

### Required M0 Runtime Shape

Artifacts using this schema should preserve, either directly or through an
embedded `Traceable State` block, the following M0-compatible runtime fields:

- provider route
- selected model identity when known
- request contract summary or request envelope signal
- runtime decision summary
- outcome triple:
  - stop reason
  - completion claim
  - final summary
- usage provenance or usage summary
- degraded or unresolved state when the run could not complete normally

### Interpretation Boundaries (Required Concrete Semantics)

When this schema is used, the runtime shape should make it understandable:

- which TRACEABLE lane or child run produced the result
- which provider route was selected or configured for that run
- whether the selected route still used the native VS Code LM host surface or a
  later external route
- which model identity the runtime actually selected when that signal exists
- whether tools were allowed, blocked, or absent for the run
- whether the child result was completed, partial, unresolved, degraded, or
  otherwise narrowed by runtime policy

### Provider Capability Rule

This child schema must not encode Copilot or VS Code LM as the only provider
route.

It must also allow text-only external providers in M0.

If a provider route cannot support tool calling for a given run, the preserved
runtime state should clearly show that the run stayed text-only or degraded,
rather than pretending that tool parity existed.

## Scope Rule

Use `tiinex.ai-provenance.runtime.v1` when the artifact or embedded state is
primarily trying to preserve a concrete TRACEABLE child-lane result or evidence
state for this repository's runtime.

This schema is for the parseable ai-provenance runtime result shape, not for the
broader abstract AI-runtime model and not for generic topic documents.

## Required M0 Runtime Shape

Artifacts using this schema should preserve, either directly or through an
embedded `Traceable State` block, the following M0-compatible runtime fields:

- provider route
- selected model identity when known
- request contract summary or request envelope signal
- runtime decision summary
- outcome triple:
  - stop reason
  - completion claim
  - final summary
- usage provenance or usage summary
- degraded or unresolved state when the run could not complete normally

## Required Concrete ai-provenance Semantics

When this schema is used, the runtime shape should make it understandable:

- which TRACEABLE lane or child run produced the result
- which provider route was selected or configured for that run
- whether the selected route still used the native VS Code LM host surface or a
  later external route
- which model identity the runtime actually selected when that signal exists
- whether tools were allowed, blocked, or absent for the run
- whether the child result was completed, partial, unresolved, degraded, or
  otherwise narrowed by runtime policy

## M0 Optional But Expected Sections

The following sections are optional at the schema layer but expected often
enough in M0 exports that readers should treat them as normal:

- tool ledger when tool calls were present
- evidence basis when grounding anchors were derived
- runtime fingerprint
- validation issues
- timing summary
- usage summary
- bounded raw model text

## Provider Capability Rule

This child schema must not encode Copilot or VS Code LM as the only provider
route.

It must also allow text-only external providers in M0.

If a provider route cannot support tool calling for a given run, the preserved
runtime state should clearly show that the run stayed text-only or degraded,
rather than pretending that tool parity existed.

## Relationship To Parent Schema

This schema is a local child of [tiinex.ai.runtime.v1](https://github.com/Tiinex/docs/blob/f87360aea750afe382aabae1fd208556a8fc99bd/.topics/.schemas/tiinex.ai.runtime.v1.schema.md).

The parent owns generic AI-runtime semantics.

This child owns only the concrete ai-provenance TRACEABLE runtime result shape,
including provider-route metadata, runtime decision summaries, bounded outcome
fields, and local evidence-oriented diagnostics that M0 already emits.

## What This Schema Is Not For

Do not use this schema for:

- generic runtime theory notes
- hand-authored design documents without concrete runtime result shape
- ordinary topic traces whose primary purpose is discussion rather than runtime
  state preservation
- speculative future provider-taxonomy design beyond the fields that M0 really
  emits
