  - Why: Fixes the Problems-surface policy so the validator reports only machine findings and does not invent new classes at the editor layer.
  - Summary: Decision note for what should and should not appear directly in Problems for the current validator line.

# Problems Surface Policy

## Decision

- State: accepted
- Subject: which validator outcomes should appear directly in Problems
- Decision: only machine findings that belong to the normalized finding set and are declared for Problems should appear directly in Problems; internal statuses and report-only states stay out of Problems

## Basis

- the validator root is machine-first and separates finding verification from content cleanup
- the current taxonomy already distinguishes surfaced findings from internal or report-only statuses
- the false-positive log shows the cases that should remain non-actionable at the Problems layer

## Consequences

- `legacy-no-checksum` stays internal/report-only unless the machine taxonomy later promotes it
- unsupported checksum methods stay out of Problems until they become explicit machine findings
- the editor layer does not invent new failure classes for the user
- bounded validation reports can still explain suppressed or internal states without turning them into actionable diagnostics

## Operational Effect

- the validator code may emit additional detail in bounded reports, but Problems should remain conservative and taxonomy-bound
- if a future state deserves Problems visibility, it must first become a machine finding with a declared default surface

## Review Conditions

- revisit if missing-proof versus broken-proof needs its own surfaced machine code
- revisit if unsupported checksum methods become actionable rather than internal
